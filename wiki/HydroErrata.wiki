= Errata for ROS Hydro Book Revision =

There is a missing step in section 4.7 "Mixing catkin and rosbuild Workspaces"

In this section, you are instructed to add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:

source ~/ros_workspace/setup.bash

The missing step is that we also need to add the following line right after above line:

export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros_workspace:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

This will ensure that your ~/ros_workspace directory remains in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
