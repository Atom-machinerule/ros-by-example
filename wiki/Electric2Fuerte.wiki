== ROS By Example - Electric to Fuerte PDF Conversion ==

*Please Note:* These instructions have only been tested under Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneric) and 12.04 (Precise)

 # Install the binary diff package bsdiff under Ubuntu:
 {{{
      $ sudo apt-get install bsdiff
 }}}

 # Move into the directory containing your ROS By Example PDF for Electric:
 {{{
      $ cd directory_containing_original_pdf
 }}}


 # Download the electric2fuerte.diff file:
 {{{
      $ wget http://www.pirobot.org/ros/rbx/electric2fuerte.diff
 }}}
 # Use the bspatch utility (part of the bsdiff package) to apply the diff to the Electric version of the PDF.  Change the source file name if you have renamed the original PDF and change the target file name if desired. (It can be anything you want but you should keep the .pdf extension.)
 {{{
      $ bspatch RBX1r6-v1.01-WithCover.pdf RBX1r6-v1.01-WithCover-Fuerte.pdf electric2fuerte.diff
 }}}


 # Bring up the new Fuerte-specific PDF in your favorite PDF reader.

 # Finally, don't forget to update your ROS By Example stack as some launch files have been added that are specific to Fuerte.  To update the stack, run the following commands:

{{{
      $ roscd rbx_vol_1
      $ svn update
      $ rosmake --pre-clean
}}}
