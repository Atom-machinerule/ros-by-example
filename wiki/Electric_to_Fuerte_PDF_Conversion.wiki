== ROS By Example - Electric to Fuerte PDF Conversion ==

*Please Note:* These instructions have only been tested under Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneric) and 12.04 (Precise)

 * Install the binary diff package `bsdiff` under Ubuntu:

   `$ sudo apt-get install bsdiff`

 * Move into the directory containing your ROS By Example PDF for Electric:

   `$ cd directory_containing_original_pdf`

 * Download the `electric2fuerte.diff` file:

   `$ wget http://ros-by-example.googlecode.com/files/electric2fuerte.diff`

 * Use the `bspatch` utility (part of the `bsdiff` package) to apply the diff to the Electric version of the PDF.  Change the source file name if you have renamed the original PDF and change the target file name if desired. (It can be anything you want but you should keep the .pdf extension.)

   `$ bspatch ros_by_example___volume_1.pdf ros_by_example___volume_1_Fuerte.pdf electric2fuerte.diff`

   The general syntax is:

   `$ bspatch source_file output_file diff_file`

 * Bring up the new Fuerte-specific PDF in your favorite PDF reader.

 * Finally, don't forget to update your ROS By Example stack as some launch files have been added that are specific to Fuerte.  To update the stack, run the following commands:

{{{
      $ roscd rbx_vol_1
      $ svn update
      $ rosmake --pre-clean
}}}
